# Changelog

This file records a description of changes, if known and cared about.

## Update 0.0001a

Affected files:

- Actors 1.2
- Concurrency-Kernel 1.1

Makes most of the `PromiseTest` testcases pass, only the ones which
depend on working futures are still broken. Adds the `FutureMaker`
class from Squeak to the `Concurrency-Kernel`.


## Update 0.0001

Affected files:

- Actors 1.1
- Concurrency-Kernel 1.0

Adds the first file out from the packages which were taken from Squeak 5.3
(contained in the Concurrency-Kernel) and the Squeak Actors (in Actors).
I just clean these files a little bit up and add it here.
