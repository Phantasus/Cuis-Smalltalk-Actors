# Original Authors of Squeak Actors

The original Author of the Squeak Actors package was Tony Garnock-Jones (tonyg)
who is also hosting a [github page about the Actors package](https://tonyg.github.io/squeak-actors).

I took the `Actors-tonyg.107.mcz` from his [Actors squeaksource.com project page](http://www.squeaksource.com/Actors.html).A screenshot of the project [overview page](file://References/squeaksource_overview_20200620.png)
was made to record the license, which is automatically MIT on squeaksource.

From that information an "original" Squeak-Actors MIT License file was derived and placed
in this project repository. A screenshot of the versions page was also made, so the exact
downloaded version can be identified, which was at the time of writing the newest one.

It was downloaded by Josef Philip Bernhart on 20th June 2020 at around 20:00 UTC.

For completeness the relevant files have these sha256sums:

# Author of the (initial) porting effort

Josef Philip Bernhart (jpb) did download the package so that it runs on Cuis-Smalltalk.
The whole Cuis Smalltalk related repository was set up by him initially.
